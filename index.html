    <p class="para-aboutme child">Hello, and welcome to the "About Me" section of this website that is entirely about me, strange isn't it? But don't worry, I'll do my best to keep it simple. First off, and most importantly, I'm a huge nerd. Anything from Star Wars to Pokemon, and I'm your guy. I'm currently working for an agricultural company, as a Logistics Specialist, but have always been interested in anything and everything to do with computers. And since this isn't my favorite line of work, I decided it was time to get more serious about getting into the CS field After doing some research, Cloud Software stood out to me. I've always wondered how the illustrious "cloud" actually worked. After learning more about cloud infrastructure and its inner workings, I was able to earn my first AWS certification, Cloud Practioner. While it was a little intimidating at first, I think I'm even more excited to get into Cloud Software and its many, many applications.</p><br>

    <ul class="list-jobs">
      <li><strong>Order Picker |</strong> Amazon Fulfillment center<br><em>9/18/17 to 12/5/17</em><br><br> I was fortunate enough to be a part of one of the first shifts to start at the new Amazon facility in Aurora, CO and was trained in a wide variety of tasks such as: loading trucks by use of a conveyor belt, fulfilling customer orders using handheld computers running custom software to assist in locating and scanning the correct UPC on each product, and operating an order picker forklift to pick and assemble cages full of customer orders in a timely manner.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Freight Team Associate |</strong> The Home Depot<br><em>3/2/2018 to 11/5/2018</em><br><br>For the first few hours of my shift, I was responsible for interacting and assisting customers, as well as closing the store for the night. After the store was closed, I assisted the truck unloading crew with sorting both pallets and carts full of packages that were organized by their department and aisle locations. Once the pallets and carts were transported to the correct department and aisle, I was responsible for correctly identifying the product in each package and stocking them in the correct if necessary. Finally, at the end of the night I was responsible for cleaning the sales floor and storing all extra products into the overhead storage in each aisle through the use of multiple forklifts including: Order Picker Forklift, Electric Pallet Jack, and Reach Forklift.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Warehouse Associate |</strong> Capstone Logistics<br><em>11/16/2018 to 8/09/2019</em><br><br>My main responsibilities were to unload trucks full of pallets using either a forklift or electric pallet jack, and identify which pallets/packages were to be unloaded. Once unloaded, high attention to detail was required to properly break down the pallets into smaller pallets that were organized by unique UPCs(up to hundreds of unique UPCs on each pallet), while sticking to strict "Ti-Hi" requirements. Furthermore, I was required to wrap each pallet with plastic to ensure the safety of each pallet to meet OSHA standards.Finally, I was given the unique opportunity to be a team lead for a week. Some of my duties during this week included: speaking with truckers to assist in securing a spot for them to park, assigning workers to trucks as they arrive for efficient unloading, and maintaining a clean and safe working environment.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Warehouse Associate |</strong> Ridley Ranchways<br><em>8/24/19 to 10/29/19</em><br><br>My position required me to operate and maintain a propane forklift during the entirety of my shift in order to: build orders for customers by hand through the use of a packing slip, maintain a safe and efficient work environment, securely load semi-trucks, and weigh out large totes of animal feed to specific customer requests. I was also responsible for cleaning up at the end of the day, which I mainly accomplished using a motorized floor scrubber.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Logistics Specialist |</strong> Growcentia<br><em>2/19/20 to Present</em><br><br>
        <!--Describe the best job ever -->During my time at Growcentia, I have been provided many opportunities to not only grow better as an employee/coworker, but also as a person. I started out filling online orders and shipping them out via a logistics software called "Fishbowl".I found myself learning more about the company and was eager to expand my role. And soon enough my responsibilities began expanding into different areas such as: inventory management, product packaging and labeling, and scheduling of international and domestic shipments. I was even given the opportunity to earn a couple of certifications for free, allowing me to earn both my "OSHA" and "Six Sigma Yellow Belt" certifications. Being that Growcentia is a pretty small company, only about 40 people total, I have been able to improve upon my team-building skills. Working with a small team means I had to learn to work with people in ways I never had to before. Being able to openly and reliably communicate and strategize with coworkers has been one of my favorite parts about working at Growcentia.
